You play as the Republic of the Colorado River in the year 2119. Your goal is to maintain a stable state until 2129. 
Each game turn represents a month in game time, so you must play through 120 turns without having your state collapse.

It's an anti-4x game. You aren't here to expand, explore, exterminate, or any of that. You just want to make a good life
for your people in a world of climate induced scarcity, predatory neighbors, and a very high carbon tax.

good luck :)
